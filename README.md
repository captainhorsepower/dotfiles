# Dotfiles

This is my first dotfiles repo! Inspired and curated by [dotfiles.eieio.xyz](http://dotfiles.eieio.xyz).

## Setup zsh

What I've found: 

- cool features can be added as plugins
- plugin managers:
    - oh-my-zsh is popular but relatively slow
    - antibody is written in go, is easy faster
    - :heavy_check_mark: zinit (previsouly zplugin) is the fastest, 
        - adds turbo mode (asyn plugin loading)
        - seems like the most complicated (steep learning curve)
- plugins that I want:
    - :heavy_check_mark: pure theme. Simple and fast, will use for now.
    - :fire: [thefuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck) corrects typos in previous command
    - :heavy_check_mark: autosugestions https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions


turns out I like hyper. It's a terminal (electron app), uses webGL. And js allows for really fun stuff within terminal!

## Restore Instructions

1. `xcode-select --install` (Command Line Tools are required for Git and Homebrew)
2. clone dotfiles repo to `~/.dotfiles`; `cd ~/.dotfiles`
5. Do one last Software Audit by editing [Brewfile](Brewfile) directly.
6. [`./install`](install)
7. Restart computer.
8. Setup up Dropbox (use multifactor authentication!) and allow files to sync before setting up dependent applications. Alfred settings are stored here. Mackup depends on this as well (and thus so do Terminal and VS Code).
9. Run `mackup restore`. Consider doing a `mackup restore --dry-run --verbose` first.
10. [Generate ssh key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh), add to GitHub, and switch remotes




Most of bootstrapping is done by [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
It creates symlinks, folders, and runs scripts that I want.

@see [install.conf.yaml](./install.conf.yaml) to see what it's actually doing
